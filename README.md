- 👋 Hi, I’m @NittyGritty74141
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything that has to do with electronics and programming (Hard- and Software)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (to fly :-) fusion360, J-Script (NodeRed), C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on repairing old electronics e.g. tube radios / amplifieres, reel tape recorders- almost all except SMD based devices (similar to Repair Café)
